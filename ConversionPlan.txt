Convertion to Java

Should make use of Spring especially spring boot and possibly MVC. Theres nothing else for that except for continuing with the course on these topics.

However there seems to be a lot of room to split classes up and Java's ability to have multiple dependencies per class can help a lot.
Key Ideas
- Seperate World class: SOLID, the World class should only store properties on the concept of the 'world' in the game and the rule mechanics it has should be seperated out
